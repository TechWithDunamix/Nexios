## 💡 Why I Built Nexio  

As a developer, I often struggled with frameworks that were either too rigid or overly complex for small-to-medium projects. Nexio was born out of a desire to simplify the development process while providing enough power to tackle real-world challenges.  

With Nexio, I hope to inspire other developers to dream bigger, code smarter, and build faster.
